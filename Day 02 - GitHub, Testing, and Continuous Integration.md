## GitHub integrations

GitHub integrations can help you make sure your software actually works on a large variety of hardware.

### Creating a new GitHub repo

We'll start by creating a new repository.

When we create a new repository, we have to make two important choices:

#### Choosing a `.gitignore`

You don't necessarily want temporary files

#### Choosing a license

Clicking on the `?`next to the liceinse chooser will take you to a license browser to help you select a license.

It's a good idea to read through the [GNU GPL Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html).
There are many nice aspects to the [GNU GPL License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), but it can get complicated when companies want to make use of it that may not want to contribute their changes/improvements back to the original project. 

If you're concerned about patents, the [Apache License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) is often a good choice, and corporations are often happy to use it.

The [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) is a minimal license with few restrictions that works well for academia and industry

There's even a [Do What the Fuck You Want To](http://www.wtfpl.net/) license that is legally valid.

The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) has a lot of great information to help guide you.
All [MolSSI](http://molssi.org)-created software must follow the [OSI Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated).
